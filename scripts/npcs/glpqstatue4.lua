addText("Long ago, a strange warrior washed upon the shores of Masteria.  This being claimed to be a member of a mysterious band of warriors that used claw like weapons and projectile-based artillery to defeat foes.   Known as ¡°Steel Fist Jack¡±, his cunning and trickery in battle was devilishly effective.  He eventually built a boat and left the Keep, in search of his former crew and captain.");
